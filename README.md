Hi, I’m Sirius GG!

I’m a Java and Haxe developer and this is the space where I host software which is related to gaming and streaming.

My non-gaming related stuff goes somewhere else.

You can reach me via [suport@siriusgg.com](mailto:suport@siriusgg.com) for support about specific software or via [contact@siriusgg.com](mailto:contact@siriusgg.com) for anything else.
