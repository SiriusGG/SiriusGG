Hi, Iâ€™m Sirius GG!

I create a variety of software for all kinds of purposes. However, this GitHub profile is the place where I only host software that is either related to gaming in general, specific games, streaming or speedrunning.

You can reach me via [support@siriusgg.com](mailto:support@siriusgg.com) for support about specific software or via [contact@siriusgg.com](mailto:contact@siriusgg.com) for anything else.
